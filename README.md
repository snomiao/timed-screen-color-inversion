# timed-screen-color-inversion

I need someone to tell me it's time to sleep. But are you the one? Obviously not. haha!

## let's get started:

### First, Turn on the Invert color function.
1. press win+i
2. search this: `invert color`, and click on `Color filter`
3. Turn on color filters
4. Allow the short cut key to toggle filter on or off
5. Select the color filter to `Inverted (reverse colors on the display)`

### Second, double click add-to-schtask.bat
If it succeed, your screen color has already inverted.
Don't panic, you can press win+ctrl+c to invert it again.

## Q&A
1. Q: how to uninstall?
   A: just click remove-from-schtask.bat

## Implementation
timed press win+ctrl+c, powered by AutoHotkeyU32.exe
